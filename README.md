# This is My Event Management Project

## My project has a few features.

## Features
- Each route has a unique URL that why anyone can find that target page by URL.

- Details on the event and option for booking for an event.

- Has a few private rounds but unfortunately, I can not do that as it has on the requirements.

- Visitors can log in or register there by their email and password and also the Google login.

- These features combine to create an engaging and user-friendly event management platform that promotes transparency, consistency, and meaningful contributions to various event causes.

## How I will manage my project state by using react useState.

- Plan the React components you'll need for the feature.
- Break down the feature into smaller tasks.
- Utilize React state and props to manage data and component interactions.
